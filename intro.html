        <p>The problem with playing board games is that they are mostly games that require more than one player in order to play. While it is possible to play these kinds of games by yourself, there exist board games that are made for a single person (that aren’t computer games), there is a feeling unique to playing a game in physical space that playing digitally can not replicate. When playing in real space, it can allow for people to view games and think about games from a unique perspective, giving them new avenues for their planning. Another problem is a beginner of a game being unable to plan their next move, and there is no easy way to transcribe the state of a board and relay it for advice. What I propose is for an agent that uses a camera-equipped device, such as one’s own phone or a tablet, that can examine a board game and make moves as if it were a second player or make suggestions for moves. For this case, a game of chess.</p>
