        <p>The idea is that the device with the agent would capture an image of the board, single out each individual piece, card, and/or dice in the image and convert that into data for the state of the board for the agent to use. In order to recognize the board state, said image would then be sent through openCV. Through OpenCV, using a homography-based method we would first define the board and its tiles, and utilize edge detection and contour recognition in order to define the objects, in this case being pieces and their positions on the board. When it comes to models for detection, there are many models available that have been already trained for boards and pieces.</p>

        <p>One such example of using computer vision for chess game recognition, done by Wolflein and Arandjelovic [3], utilized a RANSAC-based algorithm and two neural networks to turn an image of a chess board into a 3D grid-based model, tested on various different conditions, such as the lighting or angle. This method of theirs would yield a 99.83% degree of accuracy.</p>
