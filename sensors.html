      <p>When it comes to the field of automated chess playing, there have been multiple different types of sensors that could be used. Nowadays, the typical chess-playing robot would use a typical camera, such as those used on a phone, with no need for more complex additions, such as lidar. What a normal camera can capture is more than enough for a machine to comprehend the board state, since the typical chess board and its pieces are monochromatic and have defined shapes.</p>
      <img src="media/deepblue-kasparov.jpg" width="300">
      <p>Older chess-playing machines, such as Deep Blue, [4] required a human representative to relay the board state to the machine as well as perform its intended moves. In such a case, this was done to allow for the engineers to better observe Deep Blue while also providing transparency to tournament officials.</p>

      <p>There are also specialized boards that can detect what pieces are on them and the board state. Some of these boards detect pieces by having electronics attached to them which would allow them to recognize their positions, while others would simply keep track of their positioning in memory granted that it was given the board state at the start of a match.</p>
